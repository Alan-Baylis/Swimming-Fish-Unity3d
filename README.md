# Swimming-Fish-Unity3d

Fish swimming in random directions, made with Unity3d and C#

A 'game' made for babies / small children. Fish just swim around in random directions. Children can move the fish around and tap them to make the fish dissappear.

The songs in the game were taken from here: http://littlebabybum.com
